    "# Experiment: Penetrating through nail to glucose\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment is a proof of concept that a 785nm laser can be used in a Raman Setting to measure glucose underneath a nail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "When visible light hits an object, the light (photon) can either (1) pass through, (2) get absorbed, and (3) bounce back. The first scenario causes an object to be transparent while the latter two cause color. This phenomenon can also be observed in our hands, specifically, at the nail. When looking closely at the nail, a slight red-ish color is visible. This is because the light hits blood underneath the nail and bounces red color back to our eyes. This means a red light (650 - 800 nm) can travel through the nail, hit the blood, and bounce back. Thus, a 785 nm laser must be able to travel through the nail too."

    "As mentioned in the background, a red color is observable because the red light can travel/penetrate through the nail. A red 785 $\\mathrm{nm}$ laser should also inherit the same behavior. What is left to do is to prove the second condition."
